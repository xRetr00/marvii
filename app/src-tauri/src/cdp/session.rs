//! Per-account CDP session opener. One long-lived task per webview account
//! that keeps a session attached to the target for the lifetime of the
//! webview.
//!
//! Why long-lived: the session subscribes to `Page.loadEventFired` (used as
//! a belt-and-braces signal for `webview-account:load`). If we attached
//! once and dropped, the load signal would never reach the frontend.
//!
//! Pairs with the placeholder URL the webview is created with — the opener
//! finds the target by its unique `openhuman:{account_id}` marker in the
//! initial URL, injects the notification-permission shim before the page's
//! own JS runs, then navigates the target to the real provider URL with a
//! `#openhuman-account-{id}` fragment appended so other scanners
//! (discord/telegram/slack/whatsapp) can disambiguate multi-account setups
//! without title-marker injection.
