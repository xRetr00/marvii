//! Windows pre-CEF cache-lock wait (Sentry TAURI-RUST-F).
//!
//! The vendored `tauri-runtime-cef` calls `cef::initialize()` and asserts the
//! result equals `1`. When the CEF user-data-dir is still in use by another
//! OpenHuman process, `cef::initialize()` returns `0` and that assert panics
//! with `assertion left == right failed, left: 0, right: 1` — a fatal,
//! actionless crash (Sentry TAURI-RUST-F, ~3.2k events, Windows-only).
//!
//! The existing pre-CEF Win32 named-mutex guard (see `run()` in `lib.rs`)
//! already handles the *concurrent* second-launch case: a second instance
//! sees `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS` and exits before touching CEF. What it does
//! NOT cover is the *sequential relaunch race*:
//!
//!   1. Instance A's `run()` returns → the RAII mutex guard drops → the named
//!      mutex is released.
//!   2. A is still tearing down: its CEF browser process (and child
//!      processes) keep the user-data-dir cache lock for a short window.
//!   3. Instance B launches (auto-update relaunch, fast quit+reopen, a
//!      restart flow), acquires the now-free mutex, and calls
//!      `cef::initialize()` while A's cache lock is still held → `0` → panic.
//!
//! This module closes that window the same way macOS does with
//! `process_recovery::reap_stale_openhuman_processes`: before CEF init, wait
//! (bounded) for the prior instance's process(es) to exit, then proceed. If
//! the holder is still alive after the budget, exit cleanly instead of
//! initializing into a locked cache — the panic is *prevented* (we never call
//! `cef::initialize()` against a live lock), not caught/suppressed.
//!
//! Why counting same-exe processes is correct here, despite CEF spawning
//! same-exe subprocesses:
//!   - This runs BEFORE `cef::initialize()`, so *our own* CEF subprocesses do
//!     not exist yet — none of the counted processes are ours.
//!   - It runs AFTER the Win32 mutex guard, which guarantees we are the only
//!     top-level instance past that point. Any other same-exe PIDs therefore
//!     belong to the *dying prior instance* (its browser + CEF children).
//! So "other same-exe instances > 0" is a faithful "prior instance not gone
//! yet" signal, and drops to 0 once the prior instance fully exits.
//!
//! Validation note: this is Windows-only CEF-startup behaviour that cannot be
//! reproduced on a macOS dev host. The decision logic ([`decide`],
//! [`backoff_delay`]) is a pure function covered by unit tests that run on any
//! host; the Win32 process enumeration and the wait loop are exercised via a
//! Windows runner / manual repro.
