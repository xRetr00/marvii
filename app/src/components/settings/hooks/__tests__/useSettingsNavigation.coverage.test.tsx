/**
 * Coverage-focused tests for useSettingsNavigation.
 *
 * The two-pane settings restructure retired breadcrumb navigation (the
 * `breadcrumbs` field is now always empty — the sidebar replaced the trail) and
 * collapsed the old section-hub pages (`ai`, `agents-settings`, `features`,
 * `notifications-hub`, `crypto`) into leaf panels reachable from the sidebar.
 * These tests now cover:
 *  - Exact-match route resolution (no substring collisions).
 *  - Leaf routes resolving to their own registry id.
 *  - Retired hub slugs and unknown slugs resolving to 'home'.
 *  - Breadcrumbs always being empty.
