//! LLM-backed conversation summarization.
//!
//! The context [`super::ContextPipeline`] is deliberately pure — when
//! it decides the agent history is over budget and can't be rescued by
//! cheap stages (microcompact, tool-result budget), it returns
//! [`super::PipelineOutcome::AutocompactionRequested`] and trusts the
//! caller to dispatch an LLM summarization.
//!
//! This module owns that dispatch. [`Summarizer`] is the async trait
//! [`super::ContextManager`] calls on behalf of agents; the default
//! implementation [`ProviderSummarizer`] wraps an `Arc<dyn Provider>`
//! and executes a single chat completion against the same provider the
//! agent uses for its normal turns. Tests pass a mock implementation
//! so `ContextManager::reduce_before_call` can be exercised without
//! touching the network.
//!
//! ## Reduction strategy
//!
//! The summarizer keeps the `keep_recent` most-recent messages
//! untouched (so the model still has fresh context for its next turn),
//! replays the older head of the conversation as a plain-text
//! transcript, asks the LLM to compress it into a dense note, and
//! replaces the head with a single `system` [`ConversationMessage`]
//! holding that note. The API invariant
//! (`AssistantToolCalls` ↔ `ToolResults`) is preserved because we
//! never split a pair across the head/tail boundary — if the
//! boundary lands mid-pair we push it forward until it sits between
//! complete turns.
