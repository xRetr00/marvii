//! Single-shot retry wrapper around [`ComposioClient::execute_tool_once`]
//! for the post-OAuth token-propagation gap (issue #1688).
//!
//! NOTE: PR #1707 later added an in-client retry inside
//! [`ComposioClient::execute_tool`] keyed on the same auth-readiness
//! error string. To avoid stacking two retry layers (which would issue
//! up to four backend calls per logical retry — see the
//! `retries_once_only_even_when_second_call_still_errors` regression),
//! this wrapper calls the non-retrying [`ComposioClient::execute_tool_once`]
//! primitive instead. Direct callers of `execute_tool` (LinkedIn enrichment,
//! heartbeat collectors, tool schemas) still get #1707's inner retry.
//!
//! Composio reports `connection.status == ACTIVE` ~1-2s after the user
//! finishes OAuth, but its action-execution gateway can take another
//! 30-60s to sync the new token into its execution cache, run scope
//! validation against the upstream provider, and step out of its
//! first-use rate limit. During that window the gateway returns the
//! literal string `"Connection error, try to authenticate"` for normal
//! action calls — the connection is genuinely active and a second call
//! seconds later succeeds.
//!
//! The retry here is intentionally narrow:
//!
//! * single re-attempt only, after a fixed short sleep
//! * gated on a small constant list of well-known auth-error strings so
//!   a real revoked or mis-scoped connection still surfaces to the user
//!   after exactly one round-trip — never an infinite loop
//! * only the payload-level `successful = false / error = "…"` shape is
//!   eligible; transport-level errors (HTTP non-2xx, bad envelope, connect
//!   failures) propagate unchanged because the upstream
//!   [`crate::openhuman::integrations`] client already classifies and
//!   retries those separately.
//!
//! The wrapper calls the client's one-shot execution primitive instead of
//! [`ComposioClient::execute_tool`] so this layer does not stack another
//! two-attempt retry on top of the client's direct-call retry path.
