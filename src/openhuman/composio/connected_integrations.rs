/// Defensive TTL on the integrations cache.
///
/// Background: the primary invalidation path is the
/// `ComposioConnectionCreated` → `wait_for_connection_active` bus flow
/// (see [`super::bus::ComposioConnectionCreatedSubscriber`]), which
/// polls the backend for up to 60 s after `composio_authorize` returns
/// a `connectUrl`. On Windows the OAuth round-trip can exceed that
/// window (Defender SmartScreen, slower browser launch, extra consent
/// dialogs), so the invalidation call never fires and the chat
/// runtime's cache stays frozen on the pre-connect snapshot even
/// though the Settings UI polls `composio_list_connections` every 5 s
/// and shows the user as "Connected".
///
/// The cross-platform defenses we layer on top:
///   1. [`composio_list_connections`] diff-invalidates the cache whenever
///      the backend's active-toolkit set diverges from what's cached,
///      so a running UI keeps the chat cache in sync within one poll
///      interval.
///   2. This TTL caps worst-case staleness at 60 s regardless of
///      whether the UI is open, the bus fires, or the user reconnected
///      out-of-band.

/// Just-in-time fetch of every available action for a single Composio
/// toolkit, returned in the [`ConnectedIntegrationTool`] shape the
/// `integrations_agent` spawn path expects.
///
/// Unlike [`fetch_connected_integrations`] (which bulk-fetches every
/// connected toolkit's tools once per session and caches the result),
/// this helper is uncached and scoped to a single toolkit — meant to
/// be called at `integrations_agent` spawn time so the sub-agent's
/// prompt always reflects the toolkit's current action catalogue.
///
/// The filter `starts_with("{TOOLKIT}_")` matches
/// `fetch_connected_integrations_uncached`'s own namespacing rule so
/// siblings like `github` / `git` don't leak into each other's buckets.
///
/// `tags` narrows the result by Composio action tag (OR semantics). Only
/// honoured for the GitHub toolkit; passed through to `list_tools` so the
/// backend can skip the repo-list force-include and return a focused set.
///
/// Returns an empty vec when the backend has no actions for the
/// toolkit (valid steady state for a freshly-authorised integration
/// whose catalogue hasn't been published yet). Returns `Err` only for
/// transport / auth failures the caller should surface to the user.
